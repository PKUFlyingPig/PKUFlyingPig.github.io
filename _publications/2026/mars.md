    This paper presents Mars, a reward service framework designed to provide resource-efficient reward computation for RLVR training tasks. Mars establishes a batch-level constraint for each training task that relaxes latency requirements at the request level. Building on this foundation, we design a history-based resource scaling policy and a batch-level priority-based request scheduling policy.
