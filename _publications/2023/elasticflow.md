abstract: >-
    This paper proposes ElasticFlow, an elastic serverless training platform for distributed deep learning. ElasticFlow provides a 
    serverless interface with two distinct features: (i) users specify only the deep neural network (DNN) model and hyperparameters for a job, 
    but not the number of GPUs; (ii) users specify the deadline for a job, but not the amount of time to occupy GPUs.
