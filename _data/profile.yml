  <p>
    I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Peking University, where I conduct research in the <a href=https://github.com/pkusys target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
    Computer Systems Research Group </a> under the supervision of <a href=https://xinjin.github.io target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Xin Jin</a>. 
    Prior to that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science, also from Peking University.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests lie broadly in designing efficient systems for training and serving deep learning models, with a current focus on large language models (LLMs).
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of my academic work, I'm a passionate self-learner with a strong curiosity for various areas across computer science. I created a website called 
    <a href=https://csdiy.wiki target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> csdiy </a> to share my self-learning experiences and curated resources with the broader community.
